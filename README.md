### Josephus Problem
A typical Josephus Problem is an elimination game where among a set of n elements placed in a circle, every kth element is eliminated. 
The solution of the problem gives the position of the last element remaining. 
The code was aimed to work for all positive integer values of n and k, both greater than 1, list out the survivors in every cycle, and eventually arrive at the last survivor.
